1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
**ans:-** var, let, const all of these are variables but let and const is the ES6's product. now a days everybody are using let and const most of the time. the core difference amoung them, var is kind of universal variable declareation. let is also a variable where we can change the value of let variable. but const is a variable  we never can change the value of it in any other places.

2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
**ans:-** map, forEach,filter all of these are function. in map() we try to find an array of object and then after applying map() we console or get output of an new array too, by callback function. 

forEach() is kind of looping function, Here we get the array or object by the parameter and after applying forEach() we get a single value of an array or object.  

filter() is also a function. it's take an array through parameter and send an array by matching the callback function condition.

3. What are arrow functions in ES6?
**ans:-** arrow function is as like as normal function. its a new function method of the latest version of javaScript called ES6. arrow function is easy to write and its require less code for operating.

4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
**ans:-** destructuring is the method of new ES6. its actually extract the value easily from an array or object and put it in a new array or object with the all new extract values in a variable. and in the destructuring we also can change the property or index name by using clone(:) if needed. 

5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
**ans:-** Template Literals in ES6 are a new way to work with strings using backticks (`). They make it easier to concatenate strings, write multi-line strings, and embed variables or expressions directly.

Template literals in ES6 are more powerful and easier to use than traditional string concatenation.

Concatenation supports only variables (and you must calculate separately if needed).  
Template literals can directly include expressions, function calls, or calculations inside `${}`.

Editing or adding variables in concatenation often breaks the structure.  
Template literals are flexible and less error-prone.
